# Flatiron_module_one_project

Lab Members: Elena Morais & Kenneth Suen

Goals: Use the Spotify API to gather information and analyze on the top female and male artists on 2018 to find the similarities between their music.

Use Spotify API functions from spotify_api_functions.py to scrape, organize, and visualize the data. Each function should have a description explaining each function and how it works.

spotify_top_artist_analysis_and_visualization.ipynb	should give a whole walkthrough to how to obtain all data/visualiztions and how to use all functions.

All data collected can be found in the folders labeled with names ending with 'data' and 'visuals'.
